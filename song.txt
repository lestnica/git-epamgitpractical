We never steal cars but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard

Major league, who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finished
I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
